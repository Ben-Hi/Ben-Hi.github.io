		<h2>Assignment 1: Setting Up the Blog</h2>
		<h4>October 11, 2020</h4>
	  	<p>I built a website for the first time! A super barebones, <em>ugly</em>
			 	 looking website but a website all the same. I had seen html before when
			 	 I was making a Python twitter bot, but this was also the first time I had
			 	 ever written and understood html.
			</p>
			<p>I still don't fully understand what a div is, let alone how to style the
		   	 site in a non-gross manner. I thought about messing with some of the CSS
		   	 we learned in class, but I couldn't think of what I would want to style
		   	 since I didn't know many styling options.
			</p>
			<p>Google helped me figure out how the img tag was formatted before we
		   	 covered it in lecture. I also googled an HTML color code list to help
		     me choose a background color for my initial styling choice (teal vs.
			 	 seagreen was tough, went with teal). In case I need that color list in
		     the future, here's the link:
			   <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/" target="_blank">
			   htmlcolorcodes.com</a>
			</p>
			<p>For the html, I consulted the example <em>index.html</em> file that we
				 went over in lecture. I could have gone looking for more html tips and
				 tricks with google, but I figured I would learn most of what I needed
				 in class, so I would wait until later in the term before I started with
				 serious outside learning.
			</p>
			<p>In the future, I should work on the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Improve my git and GitHub fluency.</li>
					<li>Memorize the most common html tags.</li>
					<li>Learn how to style more effectively with css.</li>
					<li>Improve the styling of my blog.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
